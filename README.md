# Pitch Detection Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating and comparing different pitch detection algorithms across multiple datasets and metrics.

## üìä Key Findings

Praat emerges as the best choice for pitch detection, offering high pitch accuracy with the lowest cents error across all datasets while also providing unmatched computational efficiency (449x faster than baseline). While pYIN shows higher harmonic mean scores in some datasets, Praat's significantly lower pitch error and dramatic speed advantage make it the clear winner for both accuracy and practical applications. For a detailed breakdown of results, see [Benchmark Results](benchmark_results.md).

### Pitch accuracy (‚Üë higher is better)

| Algorithm | NSynth | PTDB | MDB-STEM-Synth | Average |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|----------|
| YAAPT | 60.1% | 79.3% | 82.8% | 74.1% |
| Praat | **81.2%** | 78.5% | **91.7%** | **83.8%** |
| SWIPE | 65.7% | 79.6% | 90.3% | 78.5% |
| RAPT | 73.3% | 67.5% | **91.7%** | 77.5% |
| pYIN | 81.0% | **81.7%** | 87.6% | 83.4% |
| TorchCREPE | N/A* | 78.2% | N/A* | N/A* |
| PENN | 70.5% | N/A* | N/A* | N/A* |

*N/A indicates the algorithm was excluded from testing on this dataset as it was used in training
