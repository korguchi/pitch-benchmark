# Pitch Detection Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating and comparing different pitch detection algorithms across multiple datasets and metrics.

## üìä Key Findings

TorchCREPE achieves the highest average harmonic-mean accuracy (79.9%) across four datasets, but suffers from lower voicing recall and being the slowest algorithm. Praat delivers the best speed-accuracy balance. It processes audio faster than all competitors while maintaining the second-best overall accuracy (59.2%). For a detailed breakdown of results, see [Benchmark Results](benchmark_results.md).

In the tables below, any entry marked with ‚Äú‚Ä†‚Äù indicates that the algorithm was trained (or partially trained) on that same dataset, so its performance on that split may be inflated by data leakage and should not be directly compared to the other methods.
