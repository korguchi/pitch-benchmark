# Pitch Detection Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating and comparing different pitch detection algorithms across multiple datasets and metrics.

## üìä Key Findings

Praat demonstrates the best overall performance, achieving the highest average harmonic-mean accuracy (79.3%) across four datasets and maintaining a 201-cent average error while processing audio faster than all the other algorithms. While TorchCREPE achieves lower pitch errors on individual datasets, it is much slower and has lower recall. For a detailed breakdown of results, see [Benchmark Results](benchmark_results.md).

In the tables below, any entry marked with ‚Äú‚Ä†‚Äù indicates that the algorithm was trained (or partially trained) on that same dataset, so its performance on that split may be inflated by data leakage and should not be directly compared to the other methods.
