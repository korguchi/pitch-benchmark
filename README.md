# Pitch Detection Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating and comparing different pitch detection algorithms across multiple datasets and metrics.

## üìä Key Findings

SwiftF0 achieves the highest average harmonic‚Äëmean accuracy (77.0%) across five datasets while also delivering near real‚Äëtime performance (‚âà42√ó faster than the TorchCREPE baseline on CPU). TorchCREPE follows with the second‚Äëhighest average accuracy (68.6%) but remains the slowest algorithm (‚âà5.5‚ÄØs to process 5‚ÄØs of audio on CPU). Praat delivers the best speed‚Äìaccuracy balance: it processes 5‚ÄØs of audio in just 7‚ÄØms on CPU (‚âà809√ó faster than TorchCREPE) while still maintaining strong overall accuracy (62.6%). For a detailed breakdown of results, see [Benchmark Results](benchmark_results.md).
