# Pitch Detection Benchmark

A comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating and comparing different pitch detection algorithms across multiple datasets and metrics.

## üìä Key Findings

SwiftF0 achieves the highest average harmonic-mean accuracy (79.6%) across six datasets while also delivering near real-time performance (‚âà42√ó faster than the TorchCREPE baseline on CPU). pYIN follows with the second-highest average accuracy (68.1%). TorchCREPE ranks third (67.8%) and remains the slowest algorithm, taking ‚âà5.5 s to process 5 s of audio on CPU. Praat delivers an excellent speed‚Äìaccuracy balance: it processes 5 s of audio in just 7 ms on CPU (‚âà809√ó faster than TorchCREPE) while maintaining a strong overall accuracy of 65.9%.
